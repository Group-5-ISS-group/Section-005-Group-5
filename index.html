                <div class="container"><p>In March 2020, our world was taken over by an extremely life threatening virus. COVID-19 took over the world one country at a time. The virus was one that resulted in many people getting extremely sick and even resulted in the death of many people. Not only was it detrimental to people's health, it had a major impact on schooling and jobs. During the peak of COVID-19, in-person school started shutting down and moved to online. This meant that students had to learn through a computer screen and teachers had to do their job through a screen for close to a year and a half. The topic of our final is about the effects that COVID-19 had on students' learning and teachers' ability to do their jobs with the sudden changes. We go in depth to cover the mental health of students and teachers during this time, attendance rate of students, disadvantages that students and teachers faced, quality of education, and much more. This topic is one that is important to focus on because education is the foundation of young students' minds and things that they learn at an early age set the path for the rest of their lives. Big changes, such as a pendemic, affect the growth of students and the quality of teachers' well being and ability to do their job.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Students from underprivileged circles feel the most difficulty in this online education, especially since internet access is not evenly distributed among the population, so the use of the internet for online learning has not produced a consistent effect. The additional problem arises from the fact that disadvantaged children can't afford to get a laptop, which has been a primary instrument for fundamental learning. These kids had to use smartphones with small screens instead of face-to-face with the teachers or laptops. The negative consequences arose when pupils continued to learn in this way, which was, of course, harming their physical and mental health. Besides, the fact that these kids had to study by phones in poor conditions, such as a dark environment, added more harm to the children’s eyes. This is why underprivileged students tend to have higher negative effects levels compared to the normal ones. As Covid-19 hit the country, attendance rate shattered across the country with the fear one child could be affected with the disease, this in turn affected test scores significantly throughout the country. About 10.1 million students became chronically absent during the events of Covid-19 (gone for more than 15 days of a school semester) which is a quarter more than their usual rate of kids are chronically absent (8 million). Another issue: These students can also miss out on information outside of the classroom. They run the risk of graduating from high school without the knowledge, attitudes, and habits needed to succeed in the workplace or in college. They lose out on social skills that are provided inside the classroom.Many students have discovered new ways to continue learning in this difficult time. It is also crucial to understand that, despite the difficulties, students, families, educators, staff, administrators, and countless others are working tirelessly to improve things for future students in school districts, state educational organizations, institutions of higher learning, and communities across the nation. The Department of Education is prepared to contribute in any way possible to this effort. For kids with trauma experiences, he said the biggest problem is that they’ve been cut off from resources they previously relied on for helping to cope and seeking protection over the last year and a half. Although schools were attempting to do the best they could to create better learning environments considering the conditions, COVID-19 was still a large obstacle which inevitably caused “a drop in overall performance [that] academic year.” (Sintema, 2020).</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">COVID-19 created a new generation of education for those who are teachers, as they have had to make a drastic change from traditional face to face learning to almost strictly online teaching. After the closure of schools, classes were strictly online only. These same classes today have the option of being in person now that COVID-19 has become less prevalent. However, some teachers decide to take advantage of the ease that online school provides and make their class online all the time. This has made online school more prevalent in today’s education system. While there are several benefits of online learning, there are also numerous drawbacks since technology is not perfect. Benefits may include being able to stay in the comfort of your own home while participating in school work, being able to do almost everything remotely, and other benefits. Drawbacks may include connection issues, not having access to certain information, and much more. Teachers are also unable to access their students' learning accordingly, as exams are not best completed online. There are risks of cheating, connection errors causing loss of answers, and other risks. Since some students don’t do well with online school, teachers struggle to get their students' attention, which can cause attendance issues and grades to drop. This also directly affects parents, as they have to be much more involved in their child's education. Teachers found themselves facing a lot of stress due to online schooling. Some teachers did not have the same amount of experience with technology and had to learn how to use technology in a way that benefited their students to the fullest. Teachers also felt like they were not able to build connections with their students since that is something that they value.</p>

Teachers are having to come up with new learning strategies in order to ensure their students are picking up the material as they would in a normal classroom setting.
